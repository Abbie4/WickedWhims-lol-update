_ = "Hey! Since you're reading this you're most likely looking for something in my mod. You might be even doing this without my permission, doesn't matter. There is just one thing I want to ask you for. It may sound risky for you, but I would like to know what are you doing. I won't stop you and if you think about, I most likely can't even stop you. That's why I would like to know what you're doing, I am interested and I won't judge you. I may even help you. Who knows. I think the only situation where I wouldn't be happy about your interest is if you're selling my mod. Please don't be such a scum. You can contact me at wickedwoohoo@gmail.com Good Luck with your coding! :)"
